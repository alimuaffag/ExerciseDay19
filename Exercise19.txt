Q1- 

1- 
   "hey from message1"

Reason:

The method getMessage1() is annotated with @Bean, so Spring executes it during application startup and prints the message inside.

//---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q2-

1- 
   "hey from message1"
   "hey from message2"

Reason:

message1 is independent
message2 depends on message3 via @Qualifier("1")

//---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Q3-

1- 
   "hey from message1" 
   "hey from message3" 
   "hey from message2" 

2- 
   "hey from message3"
   "hey from message2"
   "hey from message1"

3-
   "hey from message3"
   "hey from message1"
   "hey from message2"
   

Reason:
message1 is independent
message2 depends on message3 via @Qualifier("3")
Spring guarantees dependency order, but non-dependent beans can be initialized in any order

Q4-

1- 
   "hey from message1"
   "hey from main controller"
   "hey from message3"
   "hey from message2"

2-
   "hey from message3"
   "hey from message2"
   "hey from message1"
   "hey from main controller"

3-
   "hey from message1"
   "hey from message3"
   "hey from main controller"
   "hey from message2"

4-
   "hey from message1"
   "hey from message3"
   "hey from message2"
   "hey from main controller"

5- 
    "hey from message3"
    "hey from message1"
    "hey from main controller"  
    "hey from message2"

6- 
    "hey from message3"
    "hey from message1"
    "hey from message2"
    "hey from main controller"  
   
Reason:

MainController depends on message1 (likely injected via @Qualifier("1"))
message2 depends on message3
Spring respects dependency order first, the rest is flexible

//---------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Q5-

1-
   "hey from message3"
   "hey from message2"
   "hey from Main controller"
   "hey from message1"

Reason:

message2 depends on message3
MainController depends on message2
message1 depends on MainController as the parameter is MainController
